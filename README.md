# Introduction

This is the last project, 7/7, in GwG FEND scholarship.

# Instruction

Download or clone the repo

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Run `npm start` to start a local server.

# Offline Testing

Run `yarn build` to build the production code.
Start a server for the production folder. Otherwise, it won't work if you just open index.html since the file paths are root `/` instead of `./`
